            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm Callum! I'm 27 and live in Sydney, Australia. I'm a current student at Coder Academy, studying a Diploma of IT. I've always been interested in science and technology and tended to gravitate towards areas of logical thinking. </p>
            <h2>Work and Study History</h2>
            <p>Once finishing highschool I studied a Bachelor of Chiropractic Science and completed 1 year of a Masters of Chiropractic before realisiing it was not the right career path for me. I have worked two jobs in the last few years; a gardener / maintennance person and as a receptionist at a chiropractic clinic. </p>
            <p>Recently I have been desiring a career change and so I started teaching myself some basics of programming and fell in love with the logical and technical aspects of it. I enrolled in CoderAcademy to pursue it as a career full-time.</p>
            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            <p>I spend a lot of my free time outdoors doing activities such as skiing, hiking, rock climbing and canyoning. </p>
